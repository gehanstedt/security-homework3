## Description
This is Homework #3 from the Georgia Tech Security Bootcamp.  It has some terminal exercises to help us familiarize ourselves with commands like grep, sed, awk and others.  And, just to help us get more familiar with bash.  

Instead of doing all the scripts, I created two sets of scripts.  For player analysis, analyzeLostPlayers.bash was created to wade through data and produce a list of players and number of times they lost money.  

For dealer analysis, two scripts were created.  First was dealerAnalysis.bash which would allow you to enter the file to scan, the time of day to search and the game to search.  It would return the corresponding dealer for that date/time/game.  The second was overallDealerAnalysis.bash which was a wrapper to call dealerAnalysis.bash a few times with different arguments.  The scripts and their output are located in their original directories along with the data, but either copies or hard links are also in the Player_Dealer_Correlation directory.  They are also packaged in the Player_Dealer_Correlation.zip.

## Content-URL
N/A

## Installation
N/A - just a bunch of scripts 

## Usage
For player analysis, just run analyzeLossPlayers.bash with no argumnets.  It will create names_count_final.txt with the results.  For dealer analysis, you can either run the wrapper script overallDealerAnlysis.bash.  It will create a file called Dealers_working_during_losses.  Otherwise, you can run dealerAnalysis.bash with arguments as described above.  Output will be to stdout which you can of course redirec to a file.
